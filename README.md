# 🧠 Aadhaar Intelligence Agent Platform (AIAP)

> AI-powered decision intelligence platform for analyzing Aadhaar enrolment, demographic updates, and biometric reliability using multi-agent reasoning, RAG, live analytics, and predictive modeling.

Built for UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026.

## 🚀 Overview
AIAP is an intelligent analytics platform that helps policymakers, researchers, and planners:
	•	Understand biometric reliability patterns
	•	Detect regional anomalies and operational risks
	•	Forecast enrolment demand
	•	Simulate policy impacts
	•	Ask natural language questions over structured data

Unlike traditional dashboards, AIAP uses a multi-agent AI architecture combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and deterministic analytics to produce explainable insights with live charts.

## 📊 Supported Datasets
This project uses the following UIDAI datasets:
	1.	Aadhaar Enrolment Dataset
	2.	Aadhaar Demographic Update Dataset
	3.	Aadhaar Biometric Update Dataset

All datasets are anonymized, aggregated, and publicly available.

⚠️ No personal data, biometric images, or Aadhaar APIs are used.
